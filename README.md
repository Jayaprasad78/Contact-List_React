Hi,im jayaprasad

Im a Currently stuent of Coding Ninjas.here in this project i have created contact list from react.
All contact are taken from json using fetch API .

this is my github code repository :<>
this is my hosted Link :<>

In this project we can add new contact also,when user clcicks buttion add new contact it redirect to page where user enter his name,company name,username,mobilenumber.

add we can delete this contact also by clicking delete button.

Fetch and Show Users:

The app fetches users from the JSONPlaceholder API.
The fetched users are displayed in the contact list.
Add a Contact:

Users can add a new contact through the "Add New Contact" feature.
When a new contact is added, a dummy POST request is made to the JSONPlaceholder API.
The contact is then saved in the React state.
Update a Contact:

Users can update an existing contact's information.
The app makes a dummy PUT request to the JSONPlaceholder API to simulate updating the contact.
The contact's information is updated in the React state.
Delete a Contact:

Users can delete a contact from the contact list.
The app initiates a dummy DELETE request to the JSONPlaceholder API.
The contact is removed from the React state.
This app is for educational purposes, and the API calls for adding, updating, and deleting contacts are dummy requests.
The JSONPlaceholder API is used as a simulation, and actual data persistence on the server is not implemented.
